# DiffPong.jl [WIP]
A differentiable Pong game environment for the Julia programming language.

To run a short demo, install the package via `] add https://github.com/kraftpunk97/DiffPong.jl`

```julia
julia> using DiffPong

julia> demo()
```

To tweak the demo environment (change the ball size, change the size of the paddle, etc), make the edits at the appropriate places in the `demo.jl` file of this package.
